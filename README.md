# Groundskeeper

Groundskeeper is a Spigot plugin for Potter-themed Minecraft game servers which serves to clear the ground of dropped item entitities in a more thoughtful manner, avoiding the removal of more valuable items by default.

### Plugin Integrations

* [NathanWolf's Magic plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/magic.1056/) - Groundskeeper will avoid clearing Magic wands from off the ground.

More integrations should be added as needed. Not sure what's a good idea to add.
